# FAQ wrt Premium Licence

**What should I do if the Licence isn't working?**

Firstly, please check if you see any error logs wrt Reminder app licence on either \
\- app-level logs (Admin -> Apps -> Reminder app -> Logs)\
\- server-level logs (Admin -> View Logs)\
These logs should be generated when you're using the reminder app (eg running /remind command). Hopefully, these logs should give you a clue about what's going wrong. If you need any assistance, feel free to [contact us](../../contact-us.md)\
\
We're also aware of some known issues with older versions of Rocket.Chat app below 4.4.0 release of Rocket.Chat & 1.0.2 version of Reminder app. So if this is the case with you, then please update the reminder app to a version greater than 1.0.2.\
