# Where to find Workspace Site\_Url for License

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Your Premium license is associated with your Rocket.Chat's workspace Site\_Url.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warning: It is important to ensure that the Site\_Url is set correctly while purchasing the premium license. Major changes to the Site\_Url, such as changing it from [https://xyz.com](https://xyz.com/) to [https://abc.com](https://abc.com/), are not permitted. However, small changes, such as adding an additional backslash, are allowed. Make sure to double-check the Site\_Url before purchasing the premium license to ensure that it is correct. \

**Prerequisites:** You'd need an Admin role on your Rocket.Chat workspace.

To find the Site\_Url for your Rocket.Chat workspace, follow these steps:

1.  Open your Rocket.Chat workspace and navigate to the admin panel.&#x20;

    Or, if you're on an older version of Rocket.Chat, then:

2.  Goto General (or "Settings -> General" on newer versions ) settings panel and locate "Site\_Url" setting\

Please ensure to copy the whole value, including any special characters like backslashes and whitespaces. Older version of the app ( i.e. <= 2.4.0) are sensitive to special characters within "Site\_Url"&#x20;
