# How to set up your License on Rocket.Chat server

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: If you've purchased a license subscription (let's say yearly) and if your Rocket.Chat workspace is publically accessible on the internet and not behind a firewall, then you will NOT have to manually set up the license key and so you may ignore this guide. Your license key will get automatically updated upon each subscription renewal. You'd also receive a backup of the license keys via email.\
Please ensure that you're on version 2.5.0 and above to avail the benefit of this automated license setup.
{% endhint %}

1. Goto Apps Setting (_Administration_ -> _Apps_ -> Click on _Add Reminder_)
2. Once you're on the app setting page, there locate the _Premium License_ Setting and there add the license key you got on the email. Then just click on Save Settings and that's it. Your License has now been activated.

&#x20;  3\. (Optional) To verify if the license is set, just try out any Premium features like creating more than 5 reminders or sending reminders to channels or users.
