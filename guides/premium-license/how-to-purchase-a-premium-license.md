# How to purchase a Premium license

Here is a guide on how to purchase a Premium license for the reminder bot from the website [https://appsforchat.com/reminder-app](https://appsforchat.com/reminder-app)

1.  Go to the website [https://appsforchat.com/reminder-app](https://appsforchat.com/reminder-app) and scroll down until you locate the Pricing section.\

2. Select the subscription plan that you want to purchase and click on the "Buy now" button.
3. You will be prompted to enter your Rocket.Chat's workspace Site\_Url on the website. Fill out the required fields. Check out the guide [here](where-to-find-workspace-site\_url-for-license.md) for more info about this.
4. Next, you'd be redirected to [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/), our payment provider where you'd be asked to add your payment details like card no, or PayPal id.&#x20;
5. Once the purchase is complete, you will receive a confirmation email.

If your Rocket.Chat workspace is accessible via the internet and is not behind a firewall, then your license will be set up automatically by now and you should have access to the Premium features of the Reminder Bot app :tada:

On the other hand, if your workspace isn't public, then you'll have to manually set up the license using the license key you'd have received via email. Please refer to the following guide for more info about this process
