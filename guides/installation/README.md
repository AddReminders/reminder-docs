# Installation

There are two ways to install the Reminder App on your Rocket.Chat server.\
\
If your Rocket.Chat server is connected to [Rocket.Chat's Cloud](https://docs.rocket.chat/rocket.chat-saas/cloud-account), then you'd have access to the marketplace from where you can install the app. Please follow the following link:

{% content-ref url="install-from-marketplace-recommended.md" %}
[install-from-marketplace-recommended.md](install-from-marketplace-recommended.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

But, if you don't have a cloud account, then you can manually install the app on your server using the following guide

{% content-ref url="manual-installation.md" %}
[manual-installation.md](manual-installation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
